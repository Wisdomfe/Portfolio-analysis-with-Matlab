# Portfolio-analysis-with-Matlab
In these script I analyze a stocks portfolio with Matlab. The scripts are correlated so if you want open them follow the order: 
from Script 1 to Scrip 5. 
After plotting the stocks charts in Script 1 I analyze statistical property in Script 2.
In Script 3 I estimate Var and Es of portfolio and in the following Script 4 I calculate the Diversification Index.
In Scrip 5 I apply Principal Component Analysis to portfolio.
